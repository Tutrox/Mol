# Mol
![lint status](https://github.com/Tutrox/Mol/actions/workflows/lint.yml/badge.svg)

Mol is a simple, cool game where a character and a question is shuffled. The person who tells a correct answer gets a point.

Example:

- You get the character **S**
- The question is **"food"**

In this case you can for example say **spaghetti bolognese**.

*Right now the game is localized to Finnish and Swedish, but feel free to fork to create your own version of the game!*
